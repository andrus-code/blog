Hi! My name is Andres. Thank you for visiting this blog on github. I started this blog to post technical blogs about different in systems administration, networking, cloud computing, computer science and to practice me writing.  I am a system engineer,  based in the Argentina  and have over 10 years of experience in IT. I started my career at the service desk, and quickly became a system administrator with help some mentors. I have  worked with customers in different branches, from small business to the enterprise

As a Linux Systems Administrator I have spent most of my time with Centos and similars, different hardware and software and I’ve met a lot of really smart people along the way.

I’m just some guy who’s really interested in this stuff and hopefully what I write is reasonably accurate and helpful to you and others.
